            Hello and welcome! I’m Alex Turner—a full-time developer, lifelong learner, and all-around tech enthusiast. I write code, debug chaos, and build digital experiences that (hopefully) make people's lives a little better, or at least more convenient. Whether it’s through a web app, a script that automates repetitive tasks, or an experimental side project, I’ve always believed in using technology to create practical, beautiful solutions.
My journey into the world of coding wasn’t a straight path. Like many others in this field, it began with curiosity—tinkering with HTML and CSS in my teenage years to personalize blogs and gaming forums. What started as simple experiments quickly grew into a full-blown passion. I began learning everything I could about front-end and back-end development, teaching myself through online tutorials, documentation, and a lot of trial and error.
In college, I pursued a degree in Computer Science, which helped solidify my understanding of programming fundamentals, algorithms, and software design patterns. But the real education came outside the classroom—building real projects, collaborating with others, failing, fixing, and figuring things out under pressure. During those years, I worked on freelance gigs, helped small businesses get online, and volunteered to build websites for community groups. Each project taught me something new and made me fall more in love with coding.
Professionally, I’ve had the privilege of working across several industries—from SaaS startups to enterprise software teams. I've contributed to front-end development using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte. I’ve built RESTful APIs and back-end systems in Node.js, Python (with Flask and Django), and even dabbled in Go. I’ve worked with databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firebase, and I enjoy structuring data models that are clean, efficient, and scalable.
One of my favorite things about being a developer is the endless opportunity to learn and grow. Technology moves fast, and staying up-to-date isn’t just a necessity—it’s part of the fun. I carve out time every week to explore new tools, read developer blogs, and contribute to open-source projects when I can. I’m especially interested in automation, privacy-focused tech, and building minimal but impactful user experiences.
When I’m not coding for work, I’m often coding for fun. I have a growing collection of side projects—some are half-finished, others proudly launched. From browser extensions to productivity tools, passion projects keep me inspired and sharp. I also enjoy mentoring newer developers, whether it's through one-on-one coaching or writing tutorials and articles that break down technical topics in a simple, approachable way.
Outside the tech world, I’m a bit of a creative explorer. I enjoy photography, storytelling, and design. I believe that the best developers are also good communicators and thinkers, and I strive to bring clarity and empathy into every line of code I write. I value collaboration and believe great software is built by great teams—not just brilliant individuals. I'm happiest when I'm working with others who are driven, curious, and generous with their knowledge.
I also place a high value on balance. While I love what I do, I don’t believe in hustle culture for its own sake. Burnout doesn’t produce great software. I think creativity thrives when you have space to breathe, reflect, and experiment without fear of failure. That’s why I prioritize healthy work habits and support a culture where mental health and self-care are just as important as sprint goals and pull requests.<br />
Some quick facts about me:
            <ul>
                <li>I’m a coffee lover and can talk endlessly about pour-over methods.</li>
                <li>I speak three languages (English, Spanish, and code!).</li>
                <li>I keep a bullet journal and habit tracker to stay organized.</li>
                <li>I once built a mobile app in 48 hours during a hackathon—and it actually worked.</li>
                <li>I strongly believe dark mode should be the default on every device.</li>
            </ul>
Looking forward, my goal is to keep improving my craft and working on meaningful projects that align with my values. I’m especially interested in sustainable tech, open-source collaboration, and ethical software development. I want to build things that are not only technically impressive but also thoughtful and user-centered. Whether I’m working solo or with a team, I strive to write clean, maintainable code that makes sense six months later—not just today.
So, if you’re here because you’re curious about my work, want to collaborate, or just want to chat about cool tech, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to connecting with other developers, designers, and creative minds who are passionate about building good things on the web.
Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read my story. I’m excited for what’s ahead, and I hope to cross paths with you on this coding journey. Until then, I’ll be here—writing code, fixing bugs, and trying to make the internet a little better, one commit at a time.
